## **Overview**
Cooking Compass is an application that allows UH Mānoa students to share and search for creative recipes that respect the constraints—limited kitchen resources, cooking skills, time—many college-goers face. By providing opportunites to find creative, *doable* recipes, we aim to foster a community that celebrates resourcefulness, healthy eating, and the joy of cooking.
